# ISOGES Project Management System

This is a readme file for the ISOGES project management system, a web-based application that helps ISOGES employees to collaborate on projects, track progress and manage tasks.

The system consists of the following components:

- A front-end user interface that allows users to create and join projects, assign and complete tasks, upload and download files, send and receive messages, and view project statistics and reports.
- A back-end server that handles user authentication, data storage, file management, and business logic.
- A database that stores user information, project details, task statuses, file metadata, etc.
- A cloud service that provides file hosting, backup, and synchronization.

The system is developed using the following technologies:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end user interface.
- C# and .NET Framework for the back-end server.
- SQL Server for the database.
- Azure for the cloud service.

The system is designed to be secure, scalable, reliable, and user-friendly. It follows the best practices of web development and project management. It also adheres to the ISOGES standards and policies.

To use the system, you need to have a valid ISOGES account and an internet connection. You can access the system through any modern web browser.

For more information about the system features, installation instructions, user manual, troubleshooting tips, and feedback form, please refer to the documentation folder in this repository.
